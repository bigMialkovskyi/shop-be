Service is done, FE is working as expected.

Additional scope:

ES6 modules are used for product-service implementation
Lambda handlers (getProductsList, getProductsById) code is written not in 1 single module (file) and separated in codebase
SWAGGER documentation is created for product-service
Main error scenarious are handled by API ("Product not found" error)

Product-service API:

/products: https://szrdjudmhf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products   
/products/{Id}: https://szrdjudmhf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/products/{id}
/swagger: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/VLADMALPRO37/shop-be/1.0.0
